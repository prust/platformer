# Objective

My number one goal for this project is to keep the complexity of the code to a
minimum. This should make it easy to fix bugs & to add new features, and should
maximize "quality of dev life" or "programmer joy".

This means being disciplined to pay down technical debt immediately; to not let
it accumulate. I also intend to try different code techniques designed to
minimize complexity, like
[semantic compression](http://mollyrocket.com/casey/stream_0019.html) and
[long functions](http://number-none.com/blow/john_carmack_on_inlined_code.html)
(inlining). It also means thinking regularly & thinking hard about where the
complexity is -- trying to find ways to implement the features while letting a
minimal amount of complexity into the codebase.
